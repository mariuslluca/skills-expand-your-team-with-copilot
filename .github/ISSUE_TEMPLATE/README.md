## Template Structure

Each template is designed following GitHub's issue forms specification and includes:

1. **Required Fields**: Essential information needed to understand and implement the request
2. **Optional Fields**: Additional context that can help but isn't mandatory
3. **Validation**: Ensures critical information is provided before submission
4. **Labels**: Automatically tags issues for easy filtering and organization
5. **Structured Format**: Consistent format makes it easy for Copilot to parse and understand

## Why These Templates?

These templates ensure that:
- ✅ All necessary information is collected upfront
- ✅ Issues are consistent and easy to understand
- ✅ GitHub Copilot can automatically process and implement requests
- ✅ Less back-and-forth communication is needed
- ✅ Faster resolution of requests
